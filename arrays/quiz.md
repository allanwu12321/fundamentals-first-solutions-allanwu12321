# Arrays Quiz

1. What's the primary purpose of arrays?

Arrays are used to store ordered lists of data.

2. Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript. How do we declare them?

Arrays are declared with brackets. Within the brackets are elements of the array, separated by commas.

```javascript
[element1, element2, element3, ...];
```

3. What number represents the **first** index of an array?

0

4. How can you access the **last** element of an array (regardless of the size)?

```javascript
array[array.length - 1];
```

5. What does the `pop()` method do? Does it return any values?

`pop()` removes the last element from an array and returns the removed value. You can save this value to a variable to reference later on.
