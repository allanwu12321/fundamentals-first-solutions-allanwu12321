# Objects Quiz

1. Describe the syntax (structure) of object literals in JavaScript. How do we declare them?
   Object literals are declared with curly braces surrounding comma-separated properties.

2. What is the primary purpose of objects in JavaScript?
   Objects in JavaScript are primarily used to store collections of related data, which are particularly useful for modelling real world objects.

3. What are object properties?
   Object properties are key-value pairs where the key is a string, and the value is a data value associated with the string.

4. What are the two ways to access, update, or add an object property? What's the difference between the two?
   Dot notation and Bracket notation. The difference between the two is that Dot notation uses a `.` followed by a property name in plain text, while Bracket notation uses `[]` which contains a property name as a `string` data value.
